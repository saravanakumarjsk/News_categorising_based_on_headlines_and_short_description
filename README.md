# Bidirectional LSTM with conv_nets
This is a method for getting high accuracy and state-of-the-art results 

# what's new about it
This model out performs the typical NLP model and other LSTM methods, since the inputs are fed into a convnet and then into a LSTM it learns 
better about the features of the text.
Then the selected features are passed into the LSTM layer which is a BiDirectional LSTM, it learn from both start and from the end of the sentence.

# conclu.
Thus getting a model with higher accuracy and perfomence.

# Execution
To run this model just do:
cmd:> python filename.py

# Dynamic execution
Open jupyter notebook and run the model.
